      More computational power available

>  Less network bandwidth needed

> Question 3
> 
> In the speech recognition example, what is the problem with some labelers transcribing audio as “Um, today’s weather” and others transcribing “Umm..., today’s weather”?
>

>  The second is grammatically incorrect and we should use the first transcription. 
> 
>  We should not be transcribing “Umm.” The correct transcription, which serves the user's needs better, is just “Today’s weather. 
> 
>  The first is grammatically incorrect and we should use the second transcription. 
> 

      Either transcription is okay, but the inconsistency is problematic.

>  It is a linear process, in which we move step-by-step from scoping to deployment. (That’s why we call it a cycle. Bicycles are only good at going forward, not backward.) 
> 

      It is an iterative process, where during a later stage we might go back to an earlier stage. (That’s why we call it a cycle--it’s a circular process.)
