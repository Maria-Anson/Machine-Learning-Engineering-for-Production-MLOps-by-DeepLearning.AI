> Question 2
> 
> You are considering building a speech recognition system, where the innovation is to use a very low cost microphone that has just been newly invented. Suppose that a human, given an audio clip recorded from this new microphone, often cannot tell what was said (because the microphone has too much noise). What can you conclude from this?

>  We should get multiple labelers to transcribe each audio clip, to reduce noise.

      There is a high chance it will not be technically feasible for a learning algorithm to achieve high accuracy on this task. 
> 
>  This problem is technically feasible only if a human listening to the original sound with their own ears (not through the microphone system) can decipher what was said. 
> 
>  This problem will be technically feasible only if we can acquire significantly more data than a human will hear in their lifetime. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> That's correct! If a human labeler is unable to transcribe the audio, it's unlikely that your algorithm will be able to learn to either.

      You build the system and it gives relevant recommendations, but the system does not meaningfully improve key business metrics such as sales conversions or revenue. 
> 
> Correct
> 
> You're right! This is why it's important to evaluate the business value of a project early on in the scoping process - so that you're addressing real business problems.

      There is often a gap between MLE metrics (such as accuracy) and business metrics (such as revenue), and it is useful to try to have the teams compromise and agree on a middle ground that both teams are happy with. 
> 
>  A business team should be working alongside an MLE to optimize only the metrics that ML algorithms can, such as accuracy, without worrying about unrealistic metrics to optimize such as revenue. 
> 
>  An AI team should be directly responsible for optimizing business metrics (such as revenue). 
> 
>  So long as a project does well on MLE metrics (such as accuracy), it will be accepted by the business team.
